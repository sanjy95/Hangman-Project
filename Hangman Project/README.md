## 🎯 Project Description

This is a simple **Hangman-style game** built using Python. The game randomly selects a word from a list, and the user must guess letters one at a time.

### ✅ Milestones Completed:
- **Milestone 2**: Selected a random word from a list and validated single-letter input.
- **Milestone 3**: Created a loop to continuously ask for input, validated the guess, and checked if the letter is in the word.
- **Refactor**: Split logic into two reusable functions: `check_guess()` and `ask_for_input()` to improve readability and structure.

### 🧠 What I Learned:
- How to use functions for cleaner code
- Input validation using `len()` and `isalpha()`
- Random selection using the `random` module
- Basic refactoring techniques
